## 🎯 Features

### 📁 Advanced File Threat Scanner
*Analyzes file headers, entropy, and metadata to detect malicious or suspicious files without executing them.*

**Deep static file analysis with multiple detection vectors:**

- **Magic Number Detection** - Identifies 7+ file types (JPEG, PNG, PDF, ZIP, EXE, ELF, etc.)
- **Shannon Entropy Analysis** - Detects encrypted/packed payloads
- **MIME Type Detection** - Uses libmagic for accurate content validation
- **Metadata Extraction** - Pulls EXIF from images, page count from PDFs
- **Risk Scoring** - Heuristic-based threat assessment (0-100)
- **Extension Mismatch Detection** - Flags mismatched file types
- **Hash-based Analysis** - SHA256 fingerprinting for file tracking

**Example Output:**
```json
{
  "filename": "document.pdf",
  "size": "99061 bytes",
  "detected_type": "PDF Document",
  "entropy": "0.22%",
  "magic number" :  "255044462D312E34",
  "Status": "OK"
}
```

### 🎣 AI-Powered Phishing Detector
*Detects phishing URLs and spam messages using BERT-based ML and advanced domain impersonation checks.*

**Dual-layer phishing detection combining URL analysis & ML:**

- **Hugging Face BERT Model** - `mrm8488/bert-tiny-finetuned-sms-spam-detection`
- **URL Structural Analysis** - Detects suspicious domains & patterns
- **Brand Impersonation Detection** - Identifies lookalike domains
- **Homoglyph Detection** - Catches visual tricks (rn → m, 0 → O)
- **Suspicious TLD Detection** - Flags risky domains (.tk, .ml, .cf, .gq, .zip)
- **Risk Scoring** - Multi-factor threat assessment (0-100)

### 🔐 Password Strength Analyzer
*Evaluates password strength by scoring length, complexity, and character variety with personalized feedback.*

**Intelligent password evaluation with character-level analysis:**

| Criterion | Points | Requirement |
|-----------|--------|-------------|
| Length | 30 pts | ≥ 12 characters |
| Uppercase | 20 pts | A-Z present |
| Lowercase | 20 pts | a-z present |
| Numbers | 15 pts | 0-9 present |
| Special Characters | 15 pts | !@#$%^&*()-_+= |
| **Total** | **100 pts** | Strength score |

**Strength Levels:**
- 0-49: Weak
- 50-79: Moderate
- 80-100: Strong

### 🎯 Phishing Awareness Training
*Provides interactive simulations of phishing attacks to educate users on recognizing and avoiding threats.*

- Interactive phishing simulation environment
- Educational attack scenarios
- Safe, controlled testing ground
- Logs and feedback for learning

### 🌐 Live Network Attack Visualizer
*Displays simulated network attacks with source IPs and attack types for security awareness and SOC training.*

- Real-time attack log display
- Simulated attack types: port scans, brute force, suspicious downloads
- Source IP tracking
- Attack timeline visualization
